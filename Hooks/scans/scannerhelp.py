[123] %s requested a Planet Scan of 1:1:1 Dists(i:17) https://game.planetarion.com/waves.pl?id=1&x=1&y=1&z=1
or...
[123] %s requested a Planet Scan of 1:1:1 Dists(i:17/r:35) https://game.planetarion.com/waves.pl?id=1&x=1&y=1&z=1
The "Dists(i:17)" is the number of distorters I think the planet has, based on blocked scanners or from dev scans. The real number may be higher, or possibly lower if some distorters have been destroyed.
The "r:35" in the second example means that the user requesting the scan thinks that the planet has at least 35 distorters.
If you don't have as many amplifiers as the planet has distorters, it's probably not worth wasting your resources trying.
The URL at the end will take you straight to the waves page in-game and will do the scan. You can then copy the URL of the scan (from the "Scan Link" on the page or from your address bar) and paste it in PM to me or in any channel where I can see it.
 
To list open requests, use ".req l" (.request list) for a list in an abbreviated format: [123: (17/35) P 1:1:1]
Alternatively, ".req links" will give a list of scan URLs to click on: [123 (17/35): http://game.planetarion.com/waves.pl?id=1&x=1&y=1&z=1]
If you get blocked, you can use the "blocks" subcommand. "!req 123 b 20" would indicate that you were blocked doing the example above (the request ID, 123, is in the square brackets) and you have 20 amplifiers.
 
If you have any problems, ask. Scanners are often idle, but usually helpful when they're around!
